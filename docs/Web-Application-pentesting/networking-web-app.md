# **DNS Basics**

### **What DNS Does**

DNS = Converts **domain → IP address**

### **Subdomains**

Provide additional functionalities:

- `blog.tryhackme.com` → blog
- `api.example.com` → API

### **Domain Hierarchy**

- **Generic TLDs**: `.org`, `.com`, `.edu`
- **Country Codes**: `.in`, `.uk`, `.us`

# **8.2 DNS Record Types**

| Record | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **A Record** | IPv4 address |
| **AAAA Record** | IPv6 address |
| **CNAME** | Points a subdomain to another domain |
| **MX Record** | Email servers (with priorities) |
| **TXT Record** | Security info, additional metadata |

### **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**

Stored in TXT records → prevents email spoofing.

### **Domain Verification**

Used for ownership validation (Google, Cloudflare, etc.)

### **Practical Tools**

- `nslookup`
- `dig`
- `host`

---

# **8.3 HTTP & HTTPS**

### **HTTP**

- Operates in plain text
- Vulnerable to interception

### **HTTPS**

- Encrypted using SSL/TLS
- Protects data in transit

---

# **8.4 URL Structure**

Example URL:

`https://user:password@tryhackme.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3`

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `https` | Protocol |
| `user:password` | Credentials |
| `tryhackme.com` | Domain |
| `80` | Port |
| `/view-room` | Path |
| `?id=1` | Query string (important for injections) |
| `#task3` | Fragment (client-side only) |

---

# **8.5 HTTP Methods**

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **GET** | Retrieve data |
| **POST** | Create resource |
| **PUT** | Update resource |
| **DELETE** | Remove resource |

Used daily in pentests.

---

# **8.6 HTTP Status Codes**

- **100–199** → Informational
- **200–299** → Success
- **300–399** → Redirection
- **400–499** → Client errors
- **500–599** → Server errors

---

# **8.7 How a Web Request Works (Full Flow)**

1. User enters a URL
2. Browser checks local DNS cache
3. Queries recursive DNS server
4. If not found → Recursive server queries:
    - Root DNS server
    - TLD server
    - Authoritative DNS server
5. Authoritative server returns IP
6. Request passes through:
    - Firewalls
    - Load balancers
7. Browser connects to web server (port 80/443)
8. Sends HTTP GET request
9. Web server processes request
10. Application interacts with database
11. Browser renders the webpage

# **9. Web Crawlers & Search Engine Indexing**

---

## **9.1 What Are Web Crawlers?**

Web crawlers (also known as **spiders** or **bots**) are automated programs that:

- Visit websites
- Read & analyze their content
- Extract keywords and metadata
- Build an index for faster searching

### **How Crawlers Work (Simple Flow)**

1. Start at a URL
2. Fetch webpage content
3. Extract all text + metadata
4. Identify keywords
5. Store these keywords into a database/index
6. Move to next URLs (links inside the page)
7. Repeat the process

This index allows search engines to return results quickly when a user searches a term.

---

## **9.2 robots.txt**

A **robots.txt** file tells crawlers *what they are allowed or not allowed to index.*

Placed at:

```
https://example.com/robots.txt

```

### **Purposes**

- Block certain directories from being crawled
- Protect sensitive or irrelevant content
- Prevent server overload

 **Important for Pentesters:**

Sensitive URLs accidentally exposed in robots.txt can reveal interesting endpoints. (Common enumeration target.)

---

## **9.3 Google Dorking**

**Google Dorking** → Advanced search techniques using special operators to discover sensitive information through Google.

Examples:

- `site:example.com`
- `filetype:pdf`
- `intitle:"index of"`
- `inurl:admin`

Used in OSINT & recon phases to find:

- Exposed admin panels
- Logs
- Unsecured directories
- Sensitive files

---

## **9.4 Shodan**

Shodan is a **search engine for Internet-connected devices**:

- Routers
- Cameras
- Servers
- IoT devices
- ICS/SCADA systems

Pentesters use Shodan to:

- Identify vulnerable systems
- Check exposed ports & services
- Track outdated software
- Map attack surfaces

---

# **10. Essential Tools for Pentesters**

---

## **10.1 Nmap**

Nmap = **Network Mapper**

Used for:

- Port scanning
- Service fingerprinting
- OS detection
- Vulnerability discovery

Common commands:

```
nmap -sV target.com
nmap -A 10.10.10.10

```

---

## **10.2 Burp Suite**

Burp Suite sits **between the browser and the server**, intercepting every request and response.

### **Capabilities**

- Modify & inspect HTTP traffic
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Manual testing tools
- Fuzzing
- Repeater, Intruder, Decoder, Comparer
- Essential for pentesting & bug bounty

Burp = most important tool for web penetration testing.

---

## **10.3 OWASP ZAP**

Open-source automated scanner used for:

- Scanning vulnerabilities
- Spidering (crawling)
- Passive & active scans

Good alternative to Burp for beginners.
