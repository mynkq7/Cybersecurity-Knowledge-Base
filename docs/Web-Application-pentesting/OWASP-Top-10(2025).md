# Web Security - OWASP Top 10 (2025)

Web Security is about controlling access, protecting data and handling user input safely. Most real world attacks doesn't happens because of hacking, but basic security mistakes.

Here's the OWASP Top 10 of 2025 explained clearly:

## Broken Access Control
Occurs when an application fails to enforce what users are allowed to do.

For example:
- A regular user can access admin pages or view other users data by modifying ids or urls
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) is a great example for broken access control

## Security Misconfigurations
Happens when security settings are configured incorrectly.

Some examples are:
- Default Credentials
- Debug mode in production
- Unnecessary services enabled

Attackers often exploit these because they requires least effort.

## Cryptographic Failures
When sensitive data are not protected though cryptographic means.

For example:
- Plain text passwords
- Weak hashing algorithms
- Transmission of data without https

Poor cryptography makes data theft trivial.

## Insecure Design
When security is not considered during the design phase of the application. Architecture problem not coding bug.

For example:
- No rate limiting
- Relying on client-side validation
- Mixing admin and user logic

## Authentication Failure
When application fail to verify user identity, can lead to account takeover.

Examples:
- Weak password policies
- No multi-factor authentication
- Unlimited login attempts

## Software Supply Chain Failure
When third party libraries and services gets compromised, which applications relies on, causing major risk. This is a high-impact, large-scale threat.

For example:
- A malicious dependencies update affecting thousands of applications

## Injection
Occurs when untrusted input is executed by the system.

Examples:
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- NoSQL Injection

## Software or Data Integrity Failures
When the application doesn't verify integrity of updates, code or data.

Examples:
- Unsigned updates
- Unsafe deserialization
- Insecure CI/CD pipelines

Can lead to supply chain attacks.

## Security Logging and Alerting Failure
When critical security events are not logged, monitored and alerted which means attacks often goes unnoticed for long periods.

Examples:
- Failed logins not tracked
- No alerts for suspicious activity

## Mishandling Exceptional Conditions
When errors and edge cases aren't handled securely.

Examples:
- Database errors exposed
- Application crashes on invalid input

This leaks internal details and helps attackers.
