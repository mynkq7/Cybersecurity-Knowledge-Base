## **DOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**

IDOR happens when an attacker changes parameters like IDs in URLs, forms, or APIs and gains access to data or actions belonging to another user because the server does not verify permissions.

### **Simple Logic:**

Attacker modifies `id=1` to `id=2` → server returns data for ID=2 → unauthorized access.

### **What attacker can do:**

- View other users' data
- Modify/deletes data
- Download invoices/files
- View bank transactions
- Perform actions as another user
- Reset someone else’s password
- Account takeover

### **In simple words:**

**“Changing numbers/IDs in a request to access someone else’s data = IDOR.”**
