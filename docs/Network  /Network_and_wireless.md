# Network Vulnerabilities

Networks often suffer from common vulnerabilities such as:
- Weak passwords
- Misconfiguration
- Outdated systems

---

## Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

A Man-in-the-Middle attack allows an attacker to:
- Eavesdrop on communication
- Alter or manipulate messages between two parties

---

## Denial of Service (DoS)

In a Denial of Service attack, an attacker overwhelms a server with more traffic than it can handle, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.

---

# Wireless Protocols and Attacks

## Wi-Fi Security Protocols
- **WPA2**
- **WPA3**

These are commonly used protocols that help protect wireless data from unauthorized access.

---

## Evil Twin Attack

In an Evil Twin attack, an attacker creates a fake Wi-Fi network that appears legitimate in order to collect data from unsuspecting users.

---

## WPS Vulnerabilities

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a wireless network.

---

# Securing the Network

## Firewall
- Monitors all inbound and outbound traffic (what is coming in and going out)
- Used to protect networks from unauthorized access

### Examples of Firewall Vendors
- Palo Alto Networks
- Cisco
- pfSense

---

## Regular Updates

Keeping software and firmware up to date is crucial for securing networks against vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

---

## Strong Password Policies
- Creating strong passwords and changing them regularly enhances network security
- Weak passwords are prone to brute-force attacks

---

# Understanding Ethical Hacking

## Purpose of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hackers test systems not to exploit them, but to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

---

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

Structured methodologies such as:
- **OWASP Top 10**

Are used to identify and categorize common security vulnerabilities.

---

# Incident Response Strategy

## Developing an Incident Response Plan

Organizations should create a detailed incident response plan to handle security breaches efficiently.

---

## Threat Detection Tools

Implementing tools that monitor and analyze network traffic helps in early detection of potential security incidents.

Examples include:
- Firewalls
- Threat detection and monitoring tools

---

## Post-Incident Review

After a security incident, conducting a thorough review helps minimize weaknesses and improve future incident response strategies.

---

# How Network Security Helps in the Future

## Emerging Technologies

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are shaping the future of cybersecurity.

---

## Zero Trust Architecture

Zero Trust assumes threats exist both inside and outside the network and enforces strict verification for every access request.

---

## Continuous Learning

Staying updated with evolving security threats and technologies is essential for effective network security.
