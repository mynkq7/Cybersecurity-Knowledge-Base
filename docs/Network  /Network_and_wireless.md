# Network Vulnerabilities

Networks often suffers from common vulnerabilities like:
- Weak password
- Misconfiguration
- Outdated Systems

---

## Man in the Middle Attacks

Man in the middle attacks allows an hacker to:
- eavedrop
- Alter Messages

---

## Denial of Services

Attacker can overwhelm the server with the large number of traffic which server is capable of hence making it inaccisble

---

# Wireless Protocols and Attacks

## Wi-Fi Security Protocols
- WPA 2
- WPA 3  

Are commonly used protocols that helps protect wireless data

---

## Evil Twin Attack

An attacker can create a fake wifi network pretending as its legitimate to collect data from unsuspicious users

---

## WPS Vulnerabilities

Wifi protected has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attacker to gain unauthorise acess to the network

---

# Securing the Network

## Firewall
- Monitors all inbound and outbond traffic (what is comming in and whats going out?)
- All networks have firewalls to protect the network

### Some examples of firewall companies
- paul Alto
- Cisco
- Pfsense

---

## Regular Updates

Keeping all software and firmware is crucial for securing networks against vulnerabilities that a hacker can exploit

---

## Strong Password Policies
- Creating strong passwords and regularly changing them significantly enhance network security
- prone to bruteforce

---

# Understanding Ethical Hacking

## Purpose of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacker test the systems not to exploit them but to find and fix vulnerabilities

---

## Pentesting Methodologies

Structured methodologies like:
- OWASP Top 10  

Used to identify vulnerabilities

---

# Incident Response Strategy

If network got compromised

---

## Developing Incident Response Plan

Organisations should create a detailes incident response plan to handle security breaches efficently

---

## Threat Detection Tools

Implementing tools that monitor and anlyze traffic can help in early detection of potential security incidents

For example – implementation of:
- firewalls
- threat detection tools

---

## Post Incident Review

After security event, conducting through review can help minimaize weakness and improve future incidents response strategies

---

# How Network Security Will Help in Future

## Emerging Technologies

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are shaping security

---

## Zero Trust Architecture

Assume threts within and outside the network

---

## Continuous Learning

Staying updated in security is essential
