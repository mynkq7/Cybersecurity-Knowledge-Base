# Cross Site Scripting 
**XSS happens when an attacker inputs executable code (usually JavaScript) into vulnerable parameters like input fields, forms, or URLs.
If the website does not sanitize the input, this code gets executed inside the *victim’s browser*, giving the attacker full control.**

### **What unauthorized actions can attacker perform?**

If attacker’s script runs in the victim’s browser, the attacker can do **anything the victim can do**, including:

- **Steal cookies** (session hijacking)
- **Read any data visible to the user**
- **Modify or deface the webpage**
- **Perform actions as the victim** (change settings, send messages, make transactions)
- **Keylogging** (capture what the user types)
- **Steal tokens from local/session storage**
- **Combine with CSRF** to perform powerful chained attacks

### **In simple terms:**

**“Attacker injects code → browser executes it → attacker gains victim-level access.”**
