### Cross-Site Request Forgery:

When a user logs into a website, the site gives the browser a **session cookie** — a small “ticket” that proves,

**“This is the real logged-in user.”**

Most people never log out, so this cookie stays active for days, months, or even years.

A hacker takes advantage of this. They use **Burp Suite** to capture a real sensitive request from a website (like a **bank transfer request**).

Then they use **Repeater** to keep modifying and testing that request until they have a **perfect, working malicious version**.

Next, the hacker hides this crafted request inside a **fake website**.

The fake site might show an innocent form like:

> “What is your favourite animal?”
> 

But when the victim clicks **Submit**, the hidden malicious request is automatically sent to the bank **using the victim’s valid session cookie**.

The browser includes the cookie automatically — the attacker never needs to see it.

The bank receives the request and trusts it because:

**“This session cookie belongs to the real user.”**

The action (like money transfer) is completed silently.

The victim realizes nothing until they receive an SMS/email that their money is gone.
