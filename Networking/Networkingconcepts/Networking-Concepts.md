# Networking Concepts

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)

- Creates a secure encrypted connection between your device and a remote server  
- Used to protect data on public Wi-Fi networks or to access restricted content  
- Routes traffic through a secure server and masks the real IP address  
- Makes it appear as if browsing from another location  

**Benefits:**
- Enhances privacy  
- Hides real identity  
- Protects against hackers

## DNS (Domain Name System)

- Acts as the phone book of the internet  
- Translates domain names into corresponding IP addresses  
- Without DNS, users would need to remember long IP addresses  

---

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- Responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices within a network  

---

## NAT (Network Address Translation)

- Modifies source and destination IP addresses of packets  
- Allows multiple devices on a network to share a single public IP address  

---

## MAC (Media Access Control)

- Unique identifier assigned to each network interface card  
- Used to identify and connect devices on a network  

---

## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

- Maps IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses  
- When a device wants to communicate within the same network, it sends ARP requests to find the destination MAC address  
- Ensures data reaches the correct physical device  

---

## ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

- Used for error reporting and diagnostic purposes  

---

## VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol)

- Allows voice communication to be transmitted over the internet  
- Cost-effective and provides high-quality communication  

---

## VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

- Allows administrators to create logical networks within a physical network  
- Helps isolate traffic even when devices are on the same physical network  

---

## Routers

- Devices that connect different networks, such as a local network and the internet  
- Use IP addresses to determine the best route for data transmission  

---

## Switch

- Connects multiple devices within the same network  

---

## Firewalls

- Security device or software that monitors and controls network traffic  
- Acts as a barrier between internal networks and external networks  
- Allows or blocks traffic based on predefined security rules  
- Protects against cyber attacks, viruses, and malicious traffic  

---

## Proxy

- Acts as an intermediary between a device and the internet  
- Improves privacy  
- Filters content  
- Bypasses geographical restrictions by masking IP addresses  

---

## BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

- Manages how data is routed between different networks on the internet  
- Determines the most efficient path for data between large-scale networks  

---

## QoS (Quality of Service)

- Manages network traffic  
- Ensures priority for time-sensitive applications  
- Reduces latency and jitter  
- Improves real-time communication services  

---

## OSI Model

### Physical Layer
- Handles physical transmission of data through cables or wireless signals  

### Data Link Layer
- Ensures reliable communication using MAC addresses and frames  

### Network Layer
- Routes data based on IP addresses  

### Transport Layer
- Provides end-to-end communication, flow control, and error correction  

### Session Layer
- Manages communication sessions and maintains state  

### Presentation Layer
- Formats, compresses, and encrypts data  

### Application Layer
- Provides network services to software applications

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

- Covers a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs  

---

## LAN (Local Area Network)

- Confined to a small geographical area  

---

## Load Balancer

- Distributes traffic across multiple servers  
- Prevents server overload  
- Improves
