# Unified Kill Chain — Overview

# Concept
A combined framework that merges attacker motivations, tactics, and methodologies (drawing from models like the Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, etc.). It explains how attackers plan, gain access, move through systems, and achieve objectives.

# Purpose / Why?

Understand, predict, and defend against attacks
Connect attacker actions, behavior, and goals into a single timeline
Useful for security operations and threat modeling
# Threat Modeling (Steps)
- Identify — What assets, threats, or vulnerabilities exist?
- Assess — Analyze risk, impact, and likelihood
- Plan — Strategy for mitigation, protection, and response
- Policies / Controls — Rules, configurations, procedures implemented
# Unified Kill Chain — 18 Phases
- Reconnaissance — Research target, gather information
- Weaponization — Create malware/tool/attack vector
- Delivery — Send malware (email, USB, link, etc.)
- Social Engineering — Manipulate or trick users
- Exploitation — Use vulnerability to gain access
- Persistence — Maintain access (backdoor, registry changes, etc.)
- Defense Evasion — Disable antivirus, logs, cover tracks
- Command & Control (C2) — Establish remote communication
- Pivoting — Move from one compromised system to another
- Discovery — Scan, map, identify systems and vulnerabilities
- Privilege Escalation — Gain admin/root access
- Execution — Run malware or commands
- Credential Access — Steal passwords, tokens, or hashes
- Lateral Movement — Spread to other systems
- Collection — Gather data, files, or information
- Exfiltration — Transfer data outside the network
- Impact — Modify, delete, encrypt data; cause disruption
- Objective — Final goal (financial gain, espionage, sabotage, etc.)
