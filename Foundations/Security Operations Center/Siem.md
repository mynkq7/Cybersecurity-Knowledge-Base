# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management.
- It provides centralized logging and security visibility across an organization.
- Collects and normalizes logs from multiple sources such as servers, firewalls, IDS/IPS, applications, and endpoints.
- Supports risk management, threat detection, and regulatory compliance.
# Key Functions
- Centralized Logging
- Aggregates logs and event data from various devices and systems into a single platform.
- Ensures all activity can be monitored, analyzed, and archived.
- Risk Management
- Streamlines remediation by using advanced analytics to detect patterns, identify potential threats, and prioritize alerts.
Compliance
Provides actionable reports, alerts, and audit trails to help maintain regulatory compliance (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
SIEM Components
1. Collection
Collects and parses data from various sources such as logs, network devices, endpoints, servers, and security tools.
2. Normalization
Translates collected data into a common format for easier correlation and analysis.
3. Correlation
Recognizes and groups related events to provide a clear, contextual view of security activity.
Enables detection of complex attack patterns or multi-step intrusions.
4. Alerting
Creates and sends real-time alerts of potential security incidents to the SOC or security team for immediate review.
SIEM Features and Capabilities
Threat Hunting
Identifies and investigates unknown or advanced threats that bypass traditional security measures.
Uses behavioral analytics, threat intelligence, and anomaly detection.
Reporting and Dashboards
Generates custom reports and visual dashboards to support decision-making and security posture review.
Access Control
Protects sensitive information and ensures only authorized personnel can access or modify SIEM data.
Incident Response
Facilitates prompt and effective responses to security incidents.
Provides comprehensive forensic data, automated playbooks, and real-time investigation tools.

Log Files

Overview
Log files store events, processes, messages, and other data generated by applications, operating systems, or network devices.
They provide detailed information about actions performed by users and systems.
Log files play a crucial role in monitoring, troubleshooting, security analysis, and incident response.
Importance of Log Files
Security Monitoring: Detect unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
System Performance: Identify errors, crashes, and performance bottlenecks.
Auditing and Compliance: Maintain records for audit trails and regulatory requirements.
Incident Investigation: Provide forensic evidence during threat analysis or breach investigations.
Common Types of Log Files
Log Type	Description
System Logs	Events generated by the operating system (e.g., startup, shutdown, errors).
Application Logs	Records of events and errors generated by software applications.
Security Logs	Authentication attempts, access control changes, and security-related events.
Network Logs	Logs from routers, firewalls, switches, IDS/IPS, and other network devices.
Event Logs	Windows-specific logs that capture system, security, and application events.
Audit Logs	Track administrative actions for compliance and accountability.
