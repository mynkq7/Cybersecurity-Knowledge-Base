# Cybersecurity Knowledge Base

Status: **Active**  
Type: **Learning • Documentation • Knowledge System**

This repository is a structured cybersecurity knowledge base built through
continuous learning, hands-on study, and clear documentation of core security concepts.

It is **not** a collection of ready-made exploits or attack tools.
It focuses on understanding **how systems, networks, and applications work** —
and how security failures occur.

## Purpose

- Build strong cybersecurity fundamentals
- Organize security knowledge by domain
- Document learning clearly and honestly
- Maintain a long-term personal reference
- Create a solid foundation before advanced tooling or exploitation

Ethics first, always

No copy-paste learning

Build knowledge that compounds over time


This repository is designed to scale naturally as understanding deepens.
